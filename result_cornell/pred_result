there	are	opportunities	in	life	for	gaining	knowledge	and	experience	.	sometimes	,	in	some	cases	.	it	's	necessary	to	take	a	risk	.	i	got	to	thinking	.	i	'll	bet	a	person	could	learn	a	lot	by	getting	into	that	woman	's	apartment	.	you	know	.	sneak	in	and	hide	and	observe	.

it	would	n't	hurt	to	hear	the	plan	,	i	guess	.
alright	.	the	first	thing	is	to	get	into	her	apartment	and	open	a	window	that	i	could	crawl	into	later	.
now	,	how	are	you	going	to	do	that	?
right	out	in	the	car	i	happen	to	have	some	old	overalls	and	a	bug	spraying	rig	.	i	will	go	to	her	apartment	and	be	the	pest	control	man	.	i	will	spray	her	apartment	.	after	a	few	minutes	you	will	knock	on	her	door	,	drawing	her	attention	away	from	me	and	i	will	then	jimmy	a	window	.
what	will	i	say	when	she	comes	to	the	door	?
you	will	be	a	jehovah	's	witness	.	i	have	a	few	awake	magazines	for	you	.	you	do	n't	have	to	keep	her	very	long	.	a	few	seconds	is	all	i	'll	need	.	whatiya	think	?

--------------------
as	they	age	they	contribute	to	a	sum	that	is	the	kindling	from	which	all	future	life	comes	.	to	feel	it	,	to	know	it	,	is	to	be	in	touch	with	the	will	of	every	living	thing	.
i	do	not	think	i	like	the	sound	of	that	.
it	does	not	feel	nearly	as	frightening	as	it	sounds	.	but	the	consequences	of	such	feelings	can	be	very	frightening	.	for	it	gives	you	great	strength	.	the	strength	of	knowledge	.	the	ability	to	stand	between	the	giving	of	what	has	always	been	to	what	will	always	be	.
i	feel	hardly	nothing	.
you	have	not	been	fully	trained	.	but	you	will	learn	.	and	you	will	be	good	,	i	can	feel	that	.	you	have	apt	itude	.	this	is	why	our	friend	is	so	concerned	.
but	why	be	so	concerned	about	me	?
this	power	is	divided	amongst	you	,	me	,	and	others	like	cuts	in	a	pie	.	but	the	cuts	are	not	equal	.	some	,	like	you	and	he	,	have	more	.	much	more	.
and	you	?
i	am	a	small	player	.	but	if	by	helping	you	i	can	keep	that	monster	from	being	the	last	,	then	perhaps	my	life	has	meant	something	.
i	am	not	ready	for	this	.
you	must	be	.	you	have	responsibilities	.	you	must	learn	the	rules	.	you	can	never	attract	attention	to	yourself	,	never	show	the	side	that	will	draw	others	to	you	.	you	will	always	know	when	you	are	in	the	presence	of	another	.	beware	.	but	more	importantly	conor	macleod	,	will	be	your	battle	against	time	.	in	the	coming	years	you	will	see	kingdoms	rise	then	rot	like	wheat	.	people	will	become	a	transitory	,	pathetic	lot	.	the	only	constant	you	will	know	will	be	the	others	and	the	tradition	their	greed	and	quest	represent	.	but	life	without	morality	,	without	the	ability	to	truly	taste	the	sweetness	of	wine	and	love	,	is	no	life	at	all	.	that	is	how	the	others	exist	.	nothing	more	than	walking	corpses	living	only	to	slaughter	each	other	in	an	insane	quest	to	be	the	last	.	keep	your	soul	sewed	to	the	earth	.	do	not	become	one	of	them	.

well	,	the	thing	is	,	the	first	death	star	was	manned	by	the	imperial	army	storm	troopers	,	dignitaries	the	only	people	onboard	were	imperials	.
basically	.
so	when	they	blew	it	up	,	no	prob	.	evil	is	punished	.
and	the	second	time	around	...	?
the	second	time	around	,	it	was	n't	even	finished	yet	.	they	were	still	under	construction	.
so	?
a	construction	job	of	that	magnitude	would	require	a	helluva	lot	more	manpower	than	the	imperial	army	had	to	offer	.	i	'll	bet	there	were	independent	contractors	working	on	that	thing	plumbers	,	aluminum	siders	,	roofers	.
not	just	imperials	,	is	what	you	're	getting	at	.
exactly	.	in	order	to	get	it	built	quickly	and	quietly	they	'd	hire	anybody	who	could	do	the	job	.	do	you	think	the	average	storm	trooper	knows	how	to	install	a	toilet	main	?	all	they	know	is	killing	and	white	uniforms	.
all	right	,	so	even	if	independent	contractors	are	working	on	the	death	star	,	why	are	you	uneasy	with	its	destruction	?

i	killed	him	.
why	?
because	that	's	how	it	works	.	that	's	what	it	's	about	.	he	was	the	best	.	he	was	on	top	.
where	you	wanted	to	be	?
yes	.	as	soon	as	you	get	into	this	business	,	all	you	can	think	about	is	getting	to	the	top	.	that	's	all	there	is	.	until	then	,	there	is	nothing	.	you	are	nothing	.
how	did	you	get	into	the	business	?
the	same	way	everyone	does	the	government	,	the	agency	.
the	c.i.a	.	?
more	or	less	.
how	old	were	you	?
they	recruited	me	when	i	was	in	high	school	.
jesus	why	?
languages	.	i	was	already	fluent	in	nine	languages	.
you	were	like	a	boy	genius	?
some	people	said	that	.	i	never	thought	so	.
why	not	?
i	was	just	different	.
you	went	from	high	school	to	the	agency	?
no	.	i	graduated	from	george	washington	university	.	then	i	entered	the	agency	training	program	.
they	did	n't	give	you	a	choice	,	did	they	?
no	,	they	did	n't	.
but	you	knew	what	they	were	training	you	for	?
of	course	.	i	was	going	to	be	james	bond	.
ahhhh	...
they	are	very	good	at	what	they	do	.	it	's	very	seductive	.	the	training	,	the	weapons	,	the	travel
the	exotic	women	.
women	?	no	...	not	really	.
why	not	?
women	...	i	do	n't	...	i	do	n't	want	to	talk	about	women	.
why	?
because	you	are	a	women	.
why	did	you	leave	the	agency	?
the	same	reason	everyone	does	.	you	hear	your	name	on	c	span	and	you	realize	you	're	a	skeleton	in	someone	's	closet	and	they	're	coming	to	bury	you	.
they	tried	to	kill	you	?
yes	.	it	did	n't	matter	much	to	them	as	long	as	i	disappeared	.
then	you	went	freelance	?
the	only	thing	different	about	the	private	sector	is	that	a	general	contractor	takes	less	of	a	percentage	than	the	government	,	so	you	make	more	money	.	then	once	you	make	the	transition	,	you	realize	you	were	never	working	for	the	government	it	was	always	the	private	sector	,	the	vested	interests	and	it	's	the	same	vested	interests	that	continue	to	buy	your	plane	tickets	.
tell	me	about	the	first	time	.
my	first	take	?
yes	.
why	?
because	i	want	to	know	.
it	was	...	mechanical	.	very	precise	.	it	was	exactly	like	the	training	drill	except	for	the	adrenaline	.
are	they	usually	like	that	?
no	.	just	the	first	one	.
after	that	?
they	become	complicated	...	messy	.
did	it	ever	bother	you	?
did	it	ever	bother	james	bond	?
that	's	fiction	.
this	is	fiction	!	do	n't	you	see	that	?	this	is	another	reality	.	and	the	people	that	come	into	the	world	to	play	this	game	nobody	forces	them	!	they	're	here	,	they	know	the	rules	,	the	stakes	,	the	risks	!	do	you	understand	what	i	am	saying	?	no	one	is	innocent	including	you	!

nothing	happened	with	me	and	grace	this	morning	.
then	maybe	this	afternoon	.	when	i	sent	you	to	kill	my	wife	you	ended	up	sexing	her	instead	.
christ	,	jake	,	please
is	that	what	happened	?	did	you	even	make	it	out	to	the	desert	,	or	did	you	just	ply	the	afternoon	between	my	sheets	?
you	're	not	talking	sense	.

what	difference	does	it	make	if	i	slept	with	her	.	you	do	n't	care	about	grace	.
you	're	right	.	i	do	n't	give	a	damn	about	her	.	but	to	fuck	a	man	's	wife	behind	his	back	?	that	just	makes	a	fool	out	of	him	.	i	do	n't	like	being	made	a	fool	of	.

yes	.	sure	.	it	was	his	idea	.	i	should	have	been	the	one	to	think	of	it
my	dear	senator	,	have	you	the	faintest	idea	of	what	it	takes	to	get	a	bill	passed	?
i	know	but	you	you	're	going	to	help	.
if	i	were	triplets	,	i	could	n't	.	look	,	senator	let	me	give	you	a	rough	idea	.	a	member	has	a	bill	in	mind	like	you	a	camp	.	right	?
right	.

oh	dinner	.	yes	.	well	,	i	'm	hungry	,	too	.	i	thought	maybe	we	could	have	something	brought	in	you	know	,	like	big	executives	who	eat	off	trays	.	you	see	,	we	'	ve	got	to	light	into	this	and	get	it	going

how	?
you	get	to	your	feet	in	the	senate	and	present	it	.	then	you	take	the	bill	and	put	it	in	a	little	box	like	a	letter	box	on	the	side	of	the	rostrum	.	just	hold	it	between	thumb	and	forefinger	and	drop	it	in	.	clerks	read	it	and	refer	it	to	the	right	committee
committee	,	huh	?
committee	.
why	?
that	's	how	congress	or	any	large	body	is	run	.	all	work	has	to	be	done	by	committee	.
why	?
look	committees	small	groups	of	senators	have	to	sift	a	bill	down	look	into	it	study	it	and	report	to	the	whole	senate	.	you	ca	n't	take	a	bill	no	one	knows	anything	about	and	discuss	it	among	ninety	six	men	.	where	would	you	get	?
yes	,	i	see	that	.
good	.	where	are	we	?
some	committee	's	got	it	.
yes	.	they	give	it	to	a	sub	committee	,	where	they	really	give	it	a	going	over	hold	hearings	call	in	people	and	ask	questions	then	report	back	to	the	bigger	committee	where	it	's	considered	some	more	,	changed	,	amended	,	or	whatever	.	days	are	going	by	,	senator	.	days	weeks	.	finally	,	they	think	it	's	quite	a	bill	.	it	goes	over	to	the	house	of	representatives	for	debate	and	a	vote	.	but	it	's	got	to	wait	its	turn	on	the	calendar
calendar	?
that	's	the	order	of	business	.	your	bill	has	to	stand	way	back	there	in	line	unless	the	steering	committee	decides	it	is	important	enough	to	be
what	's	that	?
what	?
the	steering	committee	.
do	you	really	think	we	're	getting	anywhere	.
yes	.	sure	.	what	's	a	steering	committee	?
a	committee	of	the	majority	party	leaders	.	they	decide	when	a	bill	is	important	enough	to	be	moved	up	toward	the	head	of	the	list
this	is	.
pardon	me	this	is	.	where	are	we	now	?
we	're	over	in	the	house	.
yes	.	house	.	more	amendments	more	changes	and	the	bill	goes	back	to	the	senate	and	waits	its	turn	on	the	calendar	again	.	the	senate	does	n't	like	what	the	house	did	to	the	bill	.	they	make	more	changes	.	the	house	does	n't	like	those	changes	.	stymie	.	so	they	appoint	men	from	each	house	to	go	into	a	huddle	called	a	conference	and	battle	it	out	.	besides	that	,	all	the	lobbyists	interested	give	cocktail	parties	for	and	against	government	departments	get	in	their	two	cents	'	worth	cabinet	members	budget	bureaus	embassies	.	finally	,	if	the	bill	is	alive	after	all	this	vivisection	,	it	comes	to	a	vote	.	yes	,	sir	the	big	day	finally	arrives	.	and	nine	times	out	of	ten	,	they	vote	it	down	.	are	you	catching	on	,	senator	?
yes	.	shall	we	start	on	it	right	now	or	order	dinner	first	?

i	did	n't	do	that	!
you	said	you	were	here	all	day	?
yeah	,	but	i	did	n't	sell	cigarettes	to	any	kids	!
an	angry	mother	called	the	state	division	of	taxation	and	complained	that	the	man	working	at	quick	stop	convenience	sold	her	five	year	old	daughter	cigarettes	today	at	around	four	o'clock	.	division	of	taxation	calls	the	state	board	of	health	,	and	they	send	me	down	here	to	issue	a	fine	.	you	say	you	were	working	all	day	,	hence	the	fine	is	yours	.	it	's	doubled	due	to	the	incredibly	young	age	of	the	child	.
i	did	get	it	right	away	and	i	could	never	be	on	my	house	tonight

they	were	the	ones	that	put	us	together	.

this	is	n't	about	you	,	scully	.	they	're	doing	this	to	me	.
they	're	not	doing	this	,	mulder	.	i	left	behind	a	career	in	medicine	because	i	thought	i	might	make	a	difference	at	the	fbi	.	when	they	recruited	me	they	told	me	women	made	up	nine	percent	of	the	bureau	.	i	felt	this	was	not	an	impediment	,	but	an	opportunity	to	distinguish	myself	.	but	it	has	n't	turned	out	that	way	.	and	now	,	if	i	were	to	be	transferred	to	omaha	,	or	wichita	or	some	field	office	where	i	'm	sure	i	could	rise	,	it	just	does	n't	hold	the	interest	for	me	it	once	did	.	not	after	what	i	'	ve	seen	and	done	.

years	ago	,	in	la	,	i	turned	a	trick	on	sunset	and	western	.	the	guy	was	polite	and	did	n't	argue	about	the	price	.	he	parked	his	car	and	i	took	him	to	a	house	that	i	had	an	arrangement	with	.	a	fat	mexican	woman	was	watching	a	tv	and	i	told	him	to	give	her	the	twenty	for	the	room	.	there	were	three	or	four	small	naked	children	playing	on	the	floor	and	we	had	to	step	over	them	to	get	into	the	room	.	the	room	had	a	bed	and	a	dresser	.	he	lay	on	his	back	on	the	bed	and	i	put	a	rubber	on	him	and	sucked	him	for	a	while	until	he	was	hard	and	then	i	eased	on	to	him	.	about	twenty	minutes	later	there	was	a	knock	on	the	door	and	it	was	the	woman	saying	our	time	was	up	.	i	felt	kind	of	guilty	because	he	had	n't	come	and	i	offered	to	reason	with	the	woman	and	get	another	ten	minutes	,	but	he	said	it	was	all	right	and	began	dressing	.	when	we	were	ready	to	leave	the	room	he	stopped	me	and	...	hugged	me	and	kissed	me	on	the	cheek	.	he	gave	me	an	extra	hundred	as	a	tip	and	went	back	to	his	car	.	i	remember	being	relieved	that	i	would	n't	have	to	work	again	that	evening	.
