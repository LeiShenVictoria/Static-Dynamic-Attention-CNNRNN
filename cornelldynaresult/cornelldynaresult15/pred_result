alright	,	now	tell	me	.	what	is	it	?
there	are	opportunities	in	life	for	gaining	knowledge	and	experience	.	sometimes	,	in	some	cases	.	it	's	necessary	to	take	a	risk	.	i	got	to	thinking	.	i	'll	bet	a	person	could	learn	a	lot	by	getting	into	that	woman	's	apartment	.	you	know	.	sneak	in	and	hide	and	observe	.
you	said	it	was	a	strange	world	.	and	you	're	the	strangest	part	of	it	.	are	you	crazy.she	is	possibly	involved	in	murder	.	this	gives	me	the	creeps	.
settle	down	.	i	have	a	plan	which	i	think	will	work	.	there	is	very	little	for	you	to	do	,	but	i	do	need	your	help	.	.are	n't	you	curious	about	my	plan	?
it	would	n't	hurt	to	hear	the	plan	,	i	guess	.
alright	.	the	first	thing	is	to	get	into	her	apartment	and	open	a	window	that	i	could	crawl	into	later	.
now	,	how	are	you	going	to	do	that	?
right	out	in	the	car	i	happen	to	have	some	old	overalls	and	a	bug	spraying	rig	.	i	will	go	to	her	apartment	and	be	the	pest	control	man	.	i	will	spray	her	apartment	.	after	a	few	minutes	you	will	knock	on	her	door	,	drawing	her	attention	away	from	me	and	i	will	then	jimmy	a	window	.
what	will	i	say	when	she	comes	to	the	door	?
you	will	be	a	jehovah	's	witness	.	i	have	a	few	awake	magazines	for	you	.	you	do	n't	have	to	keep	her	very	long	.	a	few	seconds	is	all	i	'll	need	.	whatiya	think	?
i	do	n't	know	.	it	sounds	like	a	good	daydream	,	.	but	actually	doing	it	is	too	weird	.	too	dangerous	.
let	's	just	try	the	first	part	.	if	that	goes	well	,	we	'll	see	about	the	rest	.	no	one	will	suspect	us	,	because	no	one	would	believe	two	people	like	us	would	be	crazy	enough	to	do	something	like	this	.

so	they	build	another	death	star	,	right	?
yeah	.
now	the	first	one	they	built	was	completed	and	fully	operational	before	the	rebels	destroyed	it	.
luke	blew	it	up	.	give	credit	where	it	's	due	.
and	the	second	one	was	still	being	built	when	they	blew	it	up	.
compliments	of	lando	calrissian	.
something	just	never	sat	right	with	me	the	second	time	they	destroyed	it	.	i	could	never	put	my	finger	on	it	something	just	was	n't	right	.
and	you	figured	it	out	?
well	,	the	thing	is	,	the	first	death	star	was	manned	by	the	imperial	army	storm	troopers	,	dignitaries	the	only	people	onboard	were	imperials	.
basically	.
so	when	they	blew	it	up	,	no	prob	.	evil	is	punished	.
and	the	second	time	around	...	?
the	second	time	around	,	it	was	n't	even	finished	yet	.	they	were	still	under	construction	.
so	?
a	construction	job	of	that	magnitude	would	require	a	helluva	lot	more	manpower	than	the	imperial	army	had	to	offer	.	i	'll	bet	there	were	independent	contractors	working	on	that	thing	plumbers	,	aluminum	siders	,	roofers	.
not	just	imperials	,	is	what	you	're	getting	at	.
exactly	.	in	order	to	get	it	built	quickly	and	quietly	they	'd	hire	anybody	who	could	do	the	job	.	do	you	think	the	average	storm	trooper	knows	how	to	install	a	toilet	main	?	all	they	know	is	killing	and	white	uniforms	.
all	right	,	so	even	if	independent	contractors	are	working	on	the	death	star	,	why	are	you	uneasy	with	its	destruction	?

well	mary	,	it	's	too	bad	i	did	n't	know	i	would	have	given	you	a	real	dinner	,	but	with	my	wife	being	in	washington	have	another	piece	of	pie
no	,	really	,	thank	you	.	is	mrs	.	webster	coming	back	soon	?
well	she	hardly	ever	comes	here	she	's	not	the	type	of	woman	who	cares	to	live	in	the	country	.	yes	i	'm	all	on	my	own	sometimes	it	makes	you	feel	a	little	lonely	do	you	mind	if	i	indulge	?
of	course	not
no	,	you	would	n't	you	're	not	the	sort	of	woman	that	's	afraid	of	smoke	or	fire	but	now	let	's	talk	about	your	affairs	.
goodness	,	mr	.	webster	,	i	'	ve	done	nothing	but	talk	about	that	all	through	dinner	.
yes	,	you	'	ve	chatted	a	lot	,	woman	like	nibbling	around	the	edge	but	,	mary	,	forgive	an	old	lawyer	's	legal	mind	,	i	do	n't	think	you	ever	once	came	to	the	point	.	and	there	is	a	point	,	is	n't	there	?
why	yes	it	's	hard	to	put	it	into	words	,	mr	.	webster	.	there	's	this	matter	of	little	daniel	's	schooling	and	the	new	house	and	well	there	's	something	else	that	's	wrong	it	gets	worse	,	year	after	year	it	's	like	a	shadow	growing	i	ca	n't	really	talk	about	it	,	even	to	ma	she	puts	it	all	on	jabez	and	i	wo	n't	stand	for	that	.
i	'	ve	heard	some	odd	things	about	jabez	lately	he	seems	to	make	the	wrong	kind	of	name	for	himself	.
mr	.	webster	,	you	must	n't	believe	all	that	people	say	.
you	do	n't	have	to	defend	him	to	me	,	mary	i	'	ve	been	called	names	myself	.
you	see	,	i	do	n't	care	if	we	are	rich	or	poor	i	do	n't	care	if	we	're	big	or	small	,	all	i	care	about	is	jabez	.	he	was	the	first	man	i	loved	.	he	never	used	to	care	about	money	we	were	poor	as	job	's	turkey	,	but	none	of	us	minded	.	now	i	'	ve	seen	him	drive	the	poor	from	the	door	,	and	we	used	to	be	poor	ourselves	.	i	'	ve	seen	him	get	hard	and	mean	,	and	he	is	n't	hard	or	mean	.	i	'	ve	heard	him	mock	at	the	church	bells	the	bells	that	rang	for	our	wedding	.	that	's	not	like	him	,	mr	.	webster	it	must	be	my	fault	somehow	my	fault	.
mary	you	'	ve	talked	to	me	as	you	might	have	talked	to	your	father	and	i	believe	he	wants	me	to	help	you	a	little	.	you	see	,	sometimes	we	think	we	're	licked	in	this	life	but	we	were	n't	put	here	to	be	licked	.	do	n't	you	believe	it	.	sometimes	the	shadows	seem	to	get	hold	of	us	the	shadows	and	the	evil	but	it	is	still	up	to	us	to	fight	.	now	i	was	thinking	before	you	came	,	of	coming	over	to	cross	corners	end	of	the	month	,	to	get	acquainted	with	my	godson	and	other	things	.

how	did	you	get	into	the	business	?

women	?	no	...	not	really	.
why	not	?
women	...	i	do	n't	...	i	do	n't	want	to	talk	about	women	.
why	?
because	you	are	a	women	.
why	did	you	leave	the	agency	?
the	same	reason	everyone	does	.	you	hear	your	name	on	c	span	and	you	realize	you	're	a	skeleton	in	someone	's	closet	and	they	're	coming	to	bury	you	.
they	tried	to	kill	you	?
yes	.	it	did	n't	matter	much	to	them	as	long	as	i	disappeared	.
then	you	went	freelance	?
the	only	thing	different	about	the	private	sector	is	that	a	general	contractor	takes	less	of	a	percentage	than	the	government	,	so	you	make	more	money	.	then	once	you	make	the	transition	,	you	realize	you	were	never	working	for	the	government	it	was	always	the	private	sector	,	the	vested	interests	and	it	's	the	same	vested	interests	that	continue	to	buy	your	plane	tickets	.

do	you	really	think	we	're	getting	anywhere	.
yes	.	sure	.	what	's	a	steering	committee	?

we	expect	an	attack	on	the	convention	tomorrow	morning	,	at	daybreak	,	and	i	have	been	placed	in	charge	of	its	defense	.
what	do	you	have	in	mind	?
to	be	perfectly	honest	,	i	have	n't	the	vaguest	idea	.
are	you	serious	?
i	do	n't	even	know	whether	a	defense	is	possible	.
what	forces	do	you	have	at	your	disposal	?
about	5	,	000	troops	.
cavalry	?
the	21st	dragoons	,	about	two	or	three	hundred	troopers	.
any	cannon	?
there	are	none	here	.
where	are	they	?
well	,	i	believe	there	are	at	least	30	guns	at	sablons	.
you	could	have	them	here	by	daybreak	.
is	this	enough	to	oppose	40	,	000	men	?
properly	arranged	,	yes	.
these	are	odds	of	8	to	1	.
the	numbers	are	not	particularly	relevant	.	you	are	not	up	against	soldiers	this	is	a	mob	,	and	they	will	run	as	soon	as	things	become	sufficiently	unpleasant	.
would	you	be	prepared	to	handle	this	for	me	?
are	you	proposing	to	transfer	command	to	me	?
in	every	practical	sense	,	yes	,	but	,	officially	,	of	course	,	i	would	have	to	retain	command	.
fair	enough	.
i	must	be	honest	with	you	.	i	first	approached	three	generals	more	senior	than	yourself	,	and	they	all	very	prudently	sent	excuses	.

they	're	not	doing	this	,	mulder	.	i	left	behind	a	career	in	medicine	because	i	thought	i	might	make	a	difference	at	the	fbi	.	when	they	recruited	me	they	told	me	women	made	up	nine	percent	of	the	bureau	.	i	felt	this	was	not	an	impediment	,	but	an	opportunity	to	distinguish	myself	.	but	it	has	n't	turned	out	that	way	.	and	now	,	if	i	were	to	be	transferred	to	omaha	,	or	wichita	or	some	field	office	where	i	'm	sure	i	could	rise	,	it	just	does	n't	hold	the	interest	for	me	it	once	did	.	not	after	what	i	'	ve	seen	and	done	.

years	ago	,	in	la	,	i	turned	a	trick	on	sunset	and	western	.	the	guy	was	polite	and	did	n't	argue	about	the	price	.	he	parked	his	car	and	i	took	him	to	a	house	that	i	had	an	arrangement	with	.	a	fat	mexican	woman	was	watching	a	tv	and	i	told	him	to	give	her	the	twenty	for	the	room	.	there	were	three	or	four	small	naked	children	playing	on	the	floor	and	we	had	to	step	over	them	to	get	into	the	room	.	the	room	had	a	bed	and	a	dresser	.	he	lay	on	his	back	on	the	bed	and	i	put	a	rubber	on	him	and	sucked	him	for	a	while	until	he	was	hard	and	then	i	eased	on	to	him	.	about	twenty	minutes	later	there	was	a	knock	on	the	door	and	it	was	the	woman	saying	our	time	was	up	.	i	felt	kind	of	guilty	because	he	had	n't	come	and	i	offered	to	reason	with	the	woman	and	get	another	ten	minutes	,	but	he	said	it	was	all	right	and	began	dressing	.	when	we	were	ready	to	leave	the	room	he	stopped	me	and	...	hugged	me	and	kissed	me	on	the	cheek	.	he	gave	me	an	extra	hundred	as	a	tip	and	went	back	to	his	car	.	i	remember	being	relieved	that	i	would	n't	have	to	work	again	that	evening	.
last	spring	i	happened	to	walk	past	a	house	that	i	had	once	patronized	.	there	was	a	cool	breeze	blowing	off	the	ocean	and	through	the	window	i	could	see	a	bare	leg	.	the	girl	must	have	been	taking	a	break	between	customers	.	it	was	a	strange	moment	for	me	because	it	reminded	me	of	my	mother	and	despite	the	fact	that	i	was	late	for	something	already	i	just	stayed	there	,	loving	the	atmosphere	of	it	and	my	memory	and	...	the	reason	i	'm	telling	you	this	epilogue	is	that	i	felt	that	i	'd	come	full	circle	.
