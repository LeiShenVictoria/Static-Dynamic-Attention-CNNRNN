ah . i 'd better register then </s>
it should come out soon . but not now obviously . </s>
 </s>
go to the ubuntu forum if you ca n't get exacting help here , i believe the firm ware sda4 , can be put in a extended , so that you can delete it and put a extended in with some shrinking of other partitions , for the ubuntu and swap partitions , i have seen that advised , but confirm this . a extended partition allows you to use logical partitions and get past the 4 primary partition limit linux will run this way windows wo nt without some tweaking that i would not bother with , but supposedly the firmware partition sda4 can . most like the boot is on both so you can run the recovery we could see , but removing sda1 would mean you would have to do partition moving that may brick the windows . hard to say exactly different manufacturers set them up differently , most likely it has the bootmgr boot bcd and is tied to the recovery grub will pick it up it is whether you will be able to run the recovery i would worry about . do you have a clone of the w and a recovery or install disc ? it is not data loss it is having a backup in case you can not access the recovery . if it was me , i would clone it , remove the recovery partition , put a extended in its place and install ubuntu there . clonezilla will only clone the data , and the mbr but needs a same size partition for reinstall . i would not mess with it tell you do have a cloned backup , or if you want to buy a disc and risk losing stuff in the future have at it . a recdovery partition is not the best insurance as well , it can get infected since it is on the same hd . not install on the recovery partition remove it when you have a good clone and make a extended , where it was . </s>
yea that 's what is giving the error </s>

were you doing an install or distribution upgrade ? </s>
i said that within the set of possible errors is the fact that some propretiary bios feature could be causing problems , not that this has to be the case . at what point are you therefore working against my imagination ? quite frankly , if you fail to understand the need for considering diverse causes of errors when debugging a computer program , i doubt your experience in this field is broad enough to dismiss that cause i reiterate that the fact that windows seems to know when grub has been reinstalled suggests that something was done to the mbr , suggesting that grub installed fine . now let 's take this to its logical conclusion grub installed fine , but windows booted , therefore grub was not run . if grub installed fine into the mbr , but was not run , something must have changed the mbr before booting . make sense ? </s>
yes </s>

you suggested a problem with the live cd , and the alternative has not worked so far , the live cd would be easier to work from if you have an extra disc or a usb supergrub should get you in to the install to load grub to the mbr from there as well , about the easiest method . this is a tiny download . http www.supergrubdisk.org super grub2 disk </s>

since it works with lvm where you can expand the logical volume , it seems to me that the size of ext 4 is bounded by data in the superblock . when you increase a lv the block device increases in size , but you need to run resize2fs to allow the fs to take use of the whole block dev so , again , would n't this be the same as to increase the partition table , then reboot to apply the new partition table where the only change is increase of the partition 's end and resize2fs it to fill the device </s>

ppas do n't really present their names in that list ... it would take ages to explain it , but it 's actually better this way . with windows , you have the same libraries for instance installed over and over and over and over for many apps . here you install them once , they 're always there , and they 're only there when you need them that is , when something depends on them want to install apps offline ? makes sense . make a mirror of all or individual packages . use aptoncd . there are tons of solutions . uh . you connect to a network and use apt . 1.4 is the latest stable . </s>

could be you have the vents blocked a little . to be honest , i do n't specifically know why . my laptop barely runs fans at all . </s>
usually best bet is to make an ntfs partition you use in ubuntu . then you use that as kind of a ' shared ' partition there are some mount flags to add as options in etc fstab to decrease unnecessary writes but as far as repartitioning or starting over no you wo nt break anything there is no registry or hkcu or anything . everything is a config file and your config files are in home . for instance do a find home user in terminal note all those files starting with a dot they 're hidden config files you have to use a livecd . gparted can not work on partitions that are mounted so you ca nt run it on a partition your os is using good luck </s>

no , i was just curious .. sorry . </s>
mhmm . never challenge authority , my friend . irc is a dictatorship and you have to respect that fact . yes recommendation is to create an extra partition it sounds like what you want is a fileserver . tell me about your setup and i 'll help you more . freenode is the server hosting the ubuntu channel you 're currently talking in there 's no money in that that 's where you put your personal junk each user on your system needs a home </s>

sounds good </s>
if you reboot and hold down shift key it will let you see your grub bootloader menu . you can then hit ' e ' to edit the first entry which is the default one . and at the line that starts with ' linux ' go to the end of the line and add the nomodeset option then ctrl x to boot . this does n't actually change your config it just lets you test with this parameter to see if it will fix it . only works for that boot at the line that contains like boot vmlinuz ... etc . i mean do the edit if that magically works then you can change it permantently . i do nt think that s the problem but worth a shot maybe do you have much invested in this install yet ? i 'm wondering if you ran the livecd and just let it install restricted drivers when prompted if it would work i 'm sorry looking at your log i do n't see anything offhand . i 'm sure someone else here might be able to help more </s>
after that that should get you a prompt that you can then pipe into there is also the password file option then change the keyserver option you are telling it what server to use so change the keyserver option you are telling it to use pool.sks keyservers.net with keyserver </s>

in other words , a file system is just a way of organising data on a disk . that can be corrupted but it does n't damage the disk itself . we want to know if the disk physically believes it has failures what did it report ? if the disk believes it is healthy , this could be a fault with the usb to sata interface inside the drive enclosure . i ' ve had that happen to me multiple times short will do for now does it report the overall smart status as healthy or something else ? disks are designed to tolerate a few bad sectors and they reserve spare sectors to be used to replace bad sectors . but if too many sectors are going bad the disk runs out of spares ... and as thinkt510 says , it 's probably time to get a new disk and try to recover as much as possible mounting a file system is not the same thing as the os seeing the drive . the os sees it as dev sdb . you can use recovery tools to scan the physical device dev sdb and recovery as much as it can i suggested earlier you 'd use photorec for that not unusual . if you 're storing important data , you 'd be best off using multiple disk drives configured as a mirror array at a minimum . that ensures that at least 2 drives both have copies of everything </s>

then you 'll like it , because xubuntu can be pretty , too . d ubuntu is mostly for newer pc 's , it 's not meant to be installed in a 10 years old machine , just like you 'd expect with windows 7 or mac os x mountain lion , even if ubuntu has lower requirements . kubuntu is also a good option for newer pc 's , but it 's a bit bloated imo and it can be a bit complicated if you prefer simplicity over customizing everything , and lubuntu is a excellent option for older systems , as it 's blazing fast . </s>

the only thing that encryption helps with is if you have a laptop and you lose it , the theif wo n't be able to get your credit card information or other sensitive information from it . so you 'll still be out a laptop , but your private data stays private . and since your private data probably resides in your home directory , encrypting your home directory probably gives you all the real security you want . </s>

that 's why . ubuntu by default uses the discrete gpu and does n't normally handle switching without some additional installation . my laptop has about 2h of battery life on ubuntu , but 7h on windows because of that reason . the discrete gpu sucks a lot of power . depending on your card , you can try installing fglrx amd 's proprietary driver and catalyst control center and that might work . or you can try vga switcheroo . which may also work . the additional drivers section in ubuntu 's system settings will allow you to install fglrx </s>

samsamsupersam in that case , you 'll notice that gparted will take a long time to repartition because it will have to copy all that data to a new physical location on the disc left ward . this has a higher chance of data loss but if the re partitioning does not fail there should be no data loss . </s>

it 's a bit more complex than that . .11n achieves its theoretical maximum of 600mbit by using 4 channels at once , and by driving 4 streams along each channel simultaneously sort of . basically ignore that the box says it can do 600mbit , that 's an aggregate rate for many devices at once in theoretical optimal conditions ... ubuntu supports n if your card supports n but n is n't all that the box on the n router claims for it </s>

you just need to remove the partitions . you could even let them on your pc , they wo nt harm you . so boot a live ubuntu cd or stick , and use gparted to delete them but pay attention to not delete the windows one . then you put your windows cd in and restore the windows bootloader the actually command needs to be asked in the windows support . i do nt recon it </s>

ah , cool it probably says something like sudo update grub and the like ... i do n't know , but my guess would be to run sudo update grub in a terminal and watch the output carefully . if the output is okay i.e. a windows system was recognized i 'd do a sudo grub install dev sda if that 's your harddisk . any success ? ? ? what did n't work precisely ? what exactely did you enter ? surely not dev xxx ... the xxx is a placeholder for your actual 1st harddrive which is very likely sda . yes , hehe , sure ... moment .... any . grub will be written to the mbr of the harddrive . sudo fdisk l , and tell me the very first entry . okay , fine . those are the partitions on sda , the first and only harddrive . into the mbr , the very first section of this harddrive , where the harddrive is told that it is a harddrive and what 's on it grub will be written via sudo grub install dev sda i 'd say yes . any comments ? ? ? ooops are you in a live system now ? ? ? sorry , i thought you somehow managed to get your ubuntu on the harddrive booted . from a live cd the grub install wo n't work , of course . my fault . wait . maybe a nice guy from this chat could go with you through the chroot thingy , an alternative way of repairing grub while you 're in your live system ... yup , ubuntu is on sda4 yes , i see . it just looks like there 's nothing which could use it , i.e. no ubuntu ... you installed ubuntu in just one partition , i guess ? </s>

you just have to know . rules of thumb are if you can not read it without sudo , its important and secret if it is in a .ssh folder and begins with i d but does not end in .pub its a secret you should just lock the root password . sudo passwd l root that will replace the password with ! and disable direct access to root . that s the supported configuration for ubuntu if you look at etc shadow you will see root ! ... so roots password has been disabled . but this individual who has access to your system could have done a lot of other things to open backdoors to the system personally i would just reinstall . auditing a compromised system requires a some estimate of what the attackers capabilities are b knowledge of what attack vectors an attacker of that ability will utilize c knowledge of what an uncompromised system looks like and what is correct . i get the feeling you lack b and c </s>

yes actually i was able to install a usb version of ubuntu on a usb and boot off of that , the problem was , that the other flash i had would n't plug in when the flash drive i booted off was plugged in ... no they are to close together so i used a windows machine and installed a version of ubuntu on a flash drive using the drop down install menu , that did n't work either for that installation it would load but then get to the purple screen with the dots and freeze there , nothing else would happen yeah very , what s more annoying no one seems to have my problem . are you sure that i can boot off of a persistent bootable ubuntu usb flash drive on a mac </s>

mate is a mint thingy </s>
you probably installed grub to a partition primary or logical e.g. sda5 instead of sda mbr is master boot record . it 's the first sector 512 bytes on a hard disk . when a system boots , the bios reads the devices in the boot order , reads the mbr and sees if it has boot code in it . if it does , it loads it into memory and executes it when booting from a liveiso it is possible the live device is dev sda ... so we need to be sure to correct the device name given to grub install </s>

21.27 simplew yekoms i did do this sudo chroot mnt root it 's a british expression ... means a cup mug of tea back to simplew 's problem ... you said i guess he thinks mnt root is the root of dev sda1 no , i do n't think so . he 's using an lvm encrpyted lv as the root unlocked via etc crypttab and then dmsetup puts it in dev mapper root or similar name . so he 's manually unlocked that , and mounted dev mapper root to mnt root and he also said that the separate partition for boot is sda3 , and that he 'd done mount dev sda3 mnt root boot prior to the chroot . so the only issue left is mounting proc sys dev outside the chroot rather than inside it . easy to solve . i know ... when he returns we know how to solve his problem now </s>

yes , hp mini 311c </s>
first check if network boot is an option on your machine , if it is , it will work good its basically configure a dhcp server to provide the right extra options , set up an tftp server to supply the install image , all you need is found on the minimal netboot iso if i 'm right for that reason there might be some extra work necessary in the end like apt get install gnome usb power has to be requested by device drive , only 50ma or such are there for free with these linux users you can never be sure about malicious intent ..... </s>

that s why i put it up ! ! what i was doing was setting up my vps , but i am trying to keep the mem usage low . so i wanted to snapshot my currently installed packages so if the mem usage went way high , i could easily revert back </s>
you probably just need netmask though i have no idea , not knowing what your setup is </s>
are you now in linux ? and where does this ntfs come in the story ? i 'm still not getting what you are trying to do bootable win7 does not even exist , iirc , otherwise , ask in windows </s>
the route command will show routes . its correct if it works </s>
well . i would fire up a webbrowser , go to the search engine of my least mistrust and type something like apache reverse proxy . i 'm not going to do it for you though . </s>
yeah it creates an iso file , but i 'm not sure if it has a pure cli version </s>
oh , no , windows proxies are n't gon na work in linux , doh . </s>
ask in freenode </s>
alright ... and if i do n't want them set for the session . only for that instance of the program ? </s>
i 'm there already .. and where should i ask about questions related to ubuntu.com website ? </s>
in the irc client you 're using right now , type ' join xchat ' no quotes </s>
yes , it worked i told you already </s>
also , this is not a ubuntu issue so it is off topic for this channel , you might try asking hardware . </s>
and hopefully at that point both work . if after that you still have a non working windows we have to look at other possibilities and check the disk layout if you just reinstall that s fine , but if you are proposing to just replace etc apt sources.list with ubuntu servers then you are unsupported in this channel it should recognize your home as a unix home and preserve it but you should backup first , and you might have problems with config files in home </s>
yes ... good idea ... thx </s>
same result , no wifi card listed ... </s>
which ones ? </s>
i do n't have the drive anymore . </s>
dd is a utility which would create a bit by bit copy of the drive if its a harddrive , you can use it </s>
metioning the wasted money on an unused drive usually prompts the user to begin using it </s>
bekks alright </s>
it is not supported in here . no . and actually i do not care about that . and it is not supported in here to do so . period . </s>
i 'm pretty sure i can with gparted . i 'll delete the existing ubuntu partition and move the rapid start partition to the left , leaving all the unallocated space to the right . that will be my new ubuntu partition . yes , it is confusing . all that aside though , my major concern is whether the correct procedure to re install ubuntu without messing up my dual boot system is simply to delete the partition and then install as normal after moving partitions and consolidating space . </s>
indeed </s>
no it 's not for rescue . i already deleted that . </s>
using 10 . then ? could you cook one up for me ? </s>
.. thank you i 'll check those out as well . </s>
yes it is from install cd . </s>
do you have a open source install to run the bootscript as escott suggested , a download as well does not insure a iso that is not corrupted or burned to fast there are some outliers we have to cover . you can download via a torrent from the main ubuntu site i would do that . you can get a daily image so you are up to date and have little or no updates the day if the capture . </s>
its not always like this , there is times that dicks are here p </s>
right wait no for i in hostname hosts do sudo sed i 's drupin ubuntu g ' etc i done do n't listen to codefyre , fail command the above command starting with for is the exact command that will work , so just do that and reboot rebooting is necessary , modifying etc hosts breaks sudo until you reboot </s>

i have submitted your last suggestion . heopfeully these will be added . </s>

how do i sell a app in the software center </s>
how would i know i 'm sure i can produce others that might not argue that . i think the sync has to be under the users files the files on the os with a quick google i see this a portable dropbox for a usb . http www.petenetlive.com kb article 0000409.htm </s>
for example on a 160 gig hd i have 4 os the w7 in a 40 gig and the others since they are linux a bit smaller and a ntfs to share with the w and linux install 4 partitions , the ntfs for windows and share are primary partitions the other 3 are logicals in a extended . i use a swap in the os that adjust with needs , i do n't hibernate so this works for me a normal swap would be equal to the ram at the least . </s>
just checked the web page , its 404ing </s>

no </s>
find the old deb and install it </s>
in that case you can not open any ports there anyway </s>
imo , if you 're gon na use ubuntu without reading installation side effects , you 're gon na have a bad time . </s>
i am there , and as i told you yesterday , you have to ask someone else because i am out of clues . provide the error as i told you yesterday please </s>

run in the ubuntu terminal cat etc fstab and see if windows is in there . the statement of short term is by the wibi designer , and it is just a file in widows as well . wubi hehe windows oops nice thing is though if you like ubuntu that wubi can be transfered to a partition , rather then reinstalling it . </s>

and when you upgrade those deps ? what happens to the apps you isntalled that were designed to be installed on other systems ? the best policy is to never mix distro packages , doing so will eventually cause you problems . have you checked the ubuntu repos for the apps you want ? the ubuntu repos are huge ok , good thing you asked beforehand part of the problem will be deps . package a might have satisfied deps now but if those deps are upgraded by the ubuntu update mechanism then package a may not have satisifed deps because the ubuntu upgrade did n't upgrade the cross distro package s you might also ask in the wine channel , winehq i believe </s>

well that s specific to the app but installing apps from outside official apps is nt that common as apt provides most apps anways from official sources is the normal case using ppa 's is nt that officical while it still provides an easy option on ubuntu systems to install additional packages from random sources via apt in case you are really new to ubuntu it might make sense to install an additional linux system as virtual machine there is netbeans in freenode as well . maybe interesting as well </s>

if you are not on 12.04 then you should upgrade also in case you need a newer version that is not in the repo you may want to look into the xorg ppa on launchpad no idea , works for me ... you should read that wiki it no doubt depends on what tablet you have maybe it uses some non standard wacom hardware anyway , good luck i need to get going </s>
so it looks like you have a boot partition for ubuntu not needed but that s okay , the boot flag is not needed there but actually on the sda1 for the windows install and use . just use the custom install in the windows install to use the sda1 . you also have a sda5 unknown is this a swap and is this all encrypted ? actually the sda2 is to big for a boot , so just move the flag to sda1 , and you should be okay , the swap is showing as unknow is this due to a encryoted setuo ? you would know if you encrypted it , it is a extra process to do that . i would remake the swap by just clicking on it and remake the swap , do not delete it first as it will change the partition number . unity ? there is one for the gnome shell that works up to 12.04 </s>

so it seems , if nomodeset does n't help these all ubuntu spins run the same kernel and same x version , and this is a kernel problem that part is pretty clear with 10sec googling in a nutshell from what i gather , intel g6 's work with modeset , but amd versions are hopeless it 's a shame that ubuntu removed alternate install cd with 12.04 .. this would give you text mode installer alternative for now for you would be to install using server install cd and install ' ubuntu desktop ' metapackage afterwards so , i recommend testing that . a bit harder longer route , but will give you pretty much the same installation afterwards then you can at least try to setup x with real installation http ubuntuforums.org showthread.php ? t 1996256 there 's also something related to g6 , it 's kinda bizarre that nomodeset does n't help for you for the future machines , i recommend http www.ubuntu.com certification saves a lot of trouble to make sure it 's certified for ubuntu . also pretty much guarantees general linux support for other distros too especially i recommend thinkpads , almost every model is fully certified for linux . intel and amd do , nvidia does n't the real problem likely is some random cheap chipset , unrelated to intel 's stuff . just guessing . </s>

some types of batterys need a mostly charged state for long storage , some need a barely charged state . if the battery was mostly charged for storage shipping and then sat for a while that charge will slowly dissipate . the temperature the battery was stored in will also affect how fast that charge dissipation will take as well . if the warehouse got hot for a few days or a week it could have sapped the charge much faster so that it was mostly discharged by the time you got it . it 's not necessarily a bad sign that it was nearly dead . if it does n't hold a charge or depletes goes dead too quickly then you may have a bad battery . look at the , if it drops more than 1 or 2 in the next week i would talk to the seller about a possible replacement . </s>

that 's because mount follows the symlink and displays the device name , if you cat proc mounts which comes from the kernel you will probably see that dev disk by uuid foo is what was mounted . the dev disk by uuid namespace by its nature can not handle one uuid symlink pointing to two different devices , and it 's entirely possible for the symlink to change as devices come and go . </s>

no problem </s>
it does n't matter if it resets the grub conf file </s>
ok is there an expert in ubuntu here now ? </s>
watchdog ? watchdog is just what the manpage says it 's kind of a dead man switch , cheap version . basically , as long the user space watch dog process runs often enough to service the dev watchdog device , the kernel considers everything okay , as in even if it 's bad , it will fix itself , while if the watchdog user space process dies , it considers the system fucked up enough that will hard reset the box . </s>

what kind of computer is it ? manufacture and model i 'll see if i can find out how to get in . does it give you a splash screen ? if so , try f1 when that comes up . it will be a couple of screens in . you 'll click next and get a page where you can install updates automatically , and install third party software . then it should give you the option . that depends on you . i do , because i watch videos and listen to mp3 ' s. but , if you do n't want closed source software , then i would say no . is it saying ubuntu has detected windows ? is one of the options to install alongside windows ? i would hold off on the installation then . make sure wndows is working correctly before you do it . for some reason it 's not giving you the option to install alongside . i would close the installation cancel or just click the x and reboot . take the cd out , and make sure it boots into windows . you 'll have to find a repair disk and run the boot member fix that l3top mentioned earlier . without the cd in the drive , right ? not today at least . i would check the add remove programs and make sure it 's not installed anymore . did you try the link that l3top gave you earlier ? if so , what did it show ? again , did you try the suggestions in the link l3top gave earlier ? what version of windows are you using ? understood ... yes . you need to get the windows part fixed , otherwise it wo n't let you install alongside . something 's up with the boot member . may i pm you private message ? </s>

i believe it does give you the option to upgrade provided it can see the old install , but you have already started the upgrade process so it might not . that said , you can do a clean install without losing any of your data . just make sure that you set your home when you reach the partitioning section of the install . </s>

a spare one perhaps , just for testing </s>
right now , yes . but it 's too slow i had nvidia installed , but that cause everything to go wrong could it be cause by some glx problems ? cause that 's what it complained about all the time as well , when nvidia was installed . i have tried installing it , but it says that it depends on glx diversions 0.2.2 , which itself ca n't be installed because of nvidia installer cleanup not being there . </s>

it appears the other way around on my system , 12.10 , is there any reason this may be the case ? and is it alright to just change proc mounts , to get them mounted where i need them ? they are set up the way i want them in fstab , and the client hasnt changed , i set up a new server , the only thing in fstab that has been changed is hostname of the new server </s>

thanks for help </s>
what image did you use that did boot on this machine ? so you used the mac cd ? you can find an ubuntu 12.10 mac iso here http ubuntu.cs.utah.edu releases quantal the reason i asked is that you 're talking about booting via efi , where that image unintuitively is actually the same as the normal image , but with the efi bootloader removed because apple 's firmware is terrible and chokes with multi catalog cds . both grub and most other parts of the stack have improved efi support greatly recently , so using the latest release is definitely a good idea . </s>

precisely my point . upstream software is not optimized for ubuntu . packages in repos are actually , optimized is not the right word ... configured for ubuntu is more correct . upstream sources are generic , there may need tweaks for it to work properly in ubuntu also , compiling from source has no dependency resolution , conflicts or upgrades at all </s>
stat help is your friend </s>
okay </s>
yes , i saw , sorry . well , it looks fine , have no idea why it is n't working . maybe you tinked with compiz settings directly ? </s>
that s a whole nother mess . the standard says if you put a menu file in a certain location then its contents will be merged wiht the master menu file where specified . gnome forgets to add the emrge line , so it ends up ignoring wines menu file . xfce is the only desktop i have seen handle merging according to the standard . </s>
mestrelion okay . i 'll try that . do you think i should reduce that to e.g. 150 mb ? </s>
i do n't understand most of it , but zsh does a lot of precompiling of settings etc they came up with an ugly hack to detect if it was actually gnome terminal that was the caller , and hacking that in yes , a hack </s>

yes . well it can be . if you set up yours , it will be different from everyone else on that computer . i 'd venture that the .bashrc.save file is a backup of your old .bashrc file . apt get is a simplified version of aptitude . synaptic is just a gui front end for apt get aptitude . and both apt get and aptitude are command line frontends for dpkg . </s>

i would do a combination of what bin bash and busyboxes are telling you . boot to a live cd , mount the file system , and fix the etc passwd and etc shadow files . also , if the person does n't really need sudo access if they do n't have a good reason to install applications system wide or make system wide changes , demote them . </s>

no difference </s>
yep , you 're out of luck then . either you have to rely on the fglrx team the open source versions or go back . </s>
that 's true much of it is dedicated to ubuntu not starting at all . i 'm not sure of how to best use apport or something else to hook into the installer process . i suggest reporting this as a bug in launchpad against ubuntu installer . hopefully a response there can guide you further . good luck ! </s>

do you have another ubuntu machine that 's functioning better , or a livecd usb of any kind you can use ? while you can make a bootable usb from here , it 's easier to do from a more sane environment . so you do n't have another gnu linux system of any sort yourself , correct ? if you have a spare usb drive which you do n't completely wiping , you can fairly easily dd the ubuntu iso to the drive to make it bootable . well that makes things more interesting well , if you want to throw some interestingness of your own into the mix , you should be able to mount the iso file , chroot into it , and run grub install for grub2 from there . at which point you can configure grub to boot from an iso stored on a usb drive , from which you can install ubuntu . how much ram does this machine have ? can you take this machine 's hard drive out and put it into another machine ? did you upgrade from a pre 9.10 version of ubuntu ? the other common reason is that someone reads a really old guide , tries to run grub which is a command in grub legacy , but not grub2 , thinks that the problem is that grub is n't installed and so they run sudo apt get install grub when they really should have just used a newer guide , and grub install . are you still trying to upgrade to ubuntu 12.04 ? </s>

no problem . i 'm sure there 's a list in your computer also , but i ca n't remember exactly where it 's at . it should be a log file though . if i 'm understanding you right , you have one system that 's 12.10 and one that 's 12.04 ? and the 12.04 has an update for grub , but the 12.10 does n't ? did it say updating grub while it was doing the updates ? most likely what happened is that when you finally did all of your updates , it had to update your grub configuration , because you added a new kernel . that 's probably what it was then . either there was an update to grub itself , and it detected that you made changes to menu.lst , or it was part of the kernel update . </s>

then the modem is giving you an ip right ? that ip is typically not static , but you can often get away with setting it to whatever they gave you via dhcp until the next time it changes . it 's possible that the gui way is n't working out . so you could add it back to the interfaces file , and it should work out as you said , but it will not be manageable by the network manager . </s>

you have a couple of ways . first is to compile it yourself making a .deb to install or google for gimp ppa . ppa 's are unsupported program space where someone else has compiled the program for specific versions of ubuntu .. the ppa is installed as part of your package manager and the program s in it are then available through the normal package manager . </s>
no macbook 4 , 1 built in audio </s>
you install . and in the installer tell it to use the free space . but this is not a ubuntu question , is it ? just do n't forget to reinstall grub2 afterwards so all show up in your boot menu https help.ubuntu.com community grub2 installing reinstalling grub 2 </s>

also try a different port on the router , if you can . it could be that . if you have a static ip address set up in etc network interfaces , then purge network manager . the router does n't matter . all you have to do is pick an ip that 's outside of the range that the router assigns and use that . </s>

but you 're right it should n't be x anyway maybe it got copied to the server that way too </s>
because that does the cd in a subshell , so following shell commands will still have the same pwd . it 's good to never change the pwd except in a small program section , because that way you 're not relying on global state if you rely on global state , it 's hard to get that right . oops , misread your question , ignore my comment does it work for you now ? your alias looks fine to me </s>

so grub is seeing this on sda1 bootmgr boot bcd that is enough to have it bring it up in the menu . it would be safe to remove it i think but i would get more opinions on this , the best way would be to post this script on the uf and have them take a look . since this a uefi bios , i would just check in with ythe ones who really know this stuff as far as the double windows showing in the grub menu , the same bootmgr boot bcd are on sdb2 as well , but the actual os sdb1 has alll the normal windows boot files there so it should boot on its own . </s>

yes , boot to the live cd . windows partitioner can not resize ubuntu partitions properly </s>
correct , though a full reinstall is n't needed , i think the command is grub install </s>
how you perceive your own text </s>
lets try this another way ... what exactly are you trying to do </s>
yep yeah that is why i suggested moving both partitions is not advised at once , can you resize the sda 4 up against the sda5 as of now ? lets see a screen shot , we may just have to set you up with a fresh install and call it a day to be honest , the ubuntu has nothing in it right . that is no problem stay with me here . so we can keep trying to mess with what you have or just delete it and build the correct partitioning and do a manual install , then boot to windows to resize it . so you want to delete and install ? if you delete ubuntu you will have to reload the ms bootloader to the mbr to boot windows . so as it is you may not have a boot right now anyway , as you have moved the sda5 partition around a bunch . yes i will be here for about the next 6 hours or so . cool </s>

yes , that is your best way to do so , if it does n't work , what blazemore recommended . if fixing them does nothing and you have the same issue , clean install . but backup the home folder 's contents . that is if you have a usb hard disk , memory card or flash stick thumb drive . how many hard drives in system ? i strongly recommend getting a second hard disk installed , having if mine is the same as your setup windows on the second one , linux on the first one . two windows installs on secondary , two linuxes on primary . do you have all linux on the drive ? if you have the funds , or a spare computer that has a drive or external drive you are n't using , that could be a good step to move the data to that drive . or consider maybe another drive ? two 500 gb hard drives would be a wise decision . one with windows installs like me , a 120 gb , the other with two linux installs 500 gb . the windows one can be removed from the system , the main linux one , ubuntu can be reinstalled without affecting it . i believe reinstalling ubuntu on the primary partition should n't affect the rest of the drive . just take note of the dev sdxx address . good call . but ensure you backup the home folder s to a memory card or other backup device just to be safe . your welcome </s>
it installed some packages .. but same issue </s>

there are plenty of ways to do that . one would be to have each process create a pid file in a directory , and then write a script to collect process information for each pid file in the directory . </s>

the upstream of a given software is the original developer of that software . when we say a bug is an upstream bug it means the bug is present in the original code , it is not a fault of ubuntu 's integration and forward upstream means instead of just reporting the bug to ubuntu , also report it to the original developer no , ubuntu is based on debian , altough some software in the repository may have been developed by red hat </s>

one possible theory is that what you think is a single drive and was advertised as a single drive is really a fakeraid of some type . do you see more disks listed in ubuntu that in windows ? for example if the the raid array has a stripe size of one mib , then the first mib of one of the drives will be the same as the first mib of the array , and so when looking at that drive alone it will appear to have a gpt label with invalid partition definitions because it 's really describing the array rather than that individual drive . </s>

if you use inetd inetd is n't that popular these days because most servers are on 24 7 and you want all services running from boot . so you do nt do the whole inetd thing with servers . systemd used by fedora brings the concept back but for a different purpose reducing power usage if you want you can install inetd but most security is handled through iptables so look at and make sure you are nt looking at bsd docs because inetd is still used in bsd land </s>

this has been a repeating problem .. and not jsut from updates .. its seems this flakes out often .. i have re setup this several times .. but it had been running well for the last week .. i had done many tweaks and woudl love to find what is going wrong instead of spending hours re diong the setup </s>

its very early days , but i 'm playing around with embedded lisp so its a nice platform for me yup , certainly is its definitely just for dev at the moment , but i 'm still having plenty of fun with it . just wondered if anyone knew much about netusb as i havent really messed with it before i 'm getting the feeling i may have to do a kernel recompile to enable it though </s>
ok i should have asked , my mistake ... live versions are difficult to setup if the networking does n't work out of the box why 11.10 anyway , why not 12.10 ? ok as gnnr suggested , nameserver goes in etc resolv.conf in 11.10 ... it changes in 12.04 so be aware </s>
you can create a file etc resolvconf resolv.conf.d tail and add entries there i believe . </s>
thanks , i disabled the hud in ubuntu tweak . </s>
where did you find info about this issue ? </s>
nah , it depends on your configuration . i 'm using oh my zsh , personally </s>
it goes to the etc resolvconf resolv.conf.d head file which writes the etc resolv.conf ... convoluted i know but that 's what the devs decided </s>
thanks </s>
then use your client pc package manager to find the proper name </s>
thanks </s>
same here but not kubuntu . maybe kubuntu does not install it by default then eh ? </s>
thx </s>
you can also tab complete in bash , so if you type my and hit tab twice it will give you possible commands ps ax grep processnamehere </s>

it should not be set like that by default , i have read , write and execute permissions on my home dir for my user ls al home and that should be default well its not hard to fix it , just do ' sudo chmod u rwx home username ' ah ... you might also want to ask him why he did it in the first place then 3 well , someone with a mind and soul is likely liable for changing home dir permissions . tell him to check ' cat var log messages grep command bin chmod ' i 'm sorry , not var log message , try var log auth.log </s>

do you get the error when using aptitude instead of apt get ? </s>
but yes , it should be much smaller . i ' ve never tried network installations so i ca n't be of much help with it . if you 're running ubuntu of some form on another machine , try running the disk utility , palimpsest is the command name . see if there 's other partitions on it . if so , create a new msdos partition . if you 're on windows , run ' diskmgr.msc ' and see if there 's multiple partitions on it for example , s3 's iso9960 cdfs partition . </s>

no it 's just a way to interact with .config autostart . what are you trying to accomplish exactly ? </s>
well , yes , because it 's all windows , and i did n't change anything to unity or compiz itself </s>
any easy way , to solve the dependencies for that vlc package ? i tried with downloading each of this packages and then ran sudo dpkg i in the folder containing the packages </s>
investigate the logs before making guesses </s>
then you probably do nt need a rtos </s>

what is the difference between the versions ? so why is the 20 version no good to you ? if the only way to get that version on ubuntu is via ppa , why test using that version ? sudo add apt repository ppa a v shkop chromium dev sudo apt get update sudo apt get install chromium browser for ver 25 </s>

download it then run dpkg i on it also it sounds like gnome or x is having some issues , i 'm not sure how to debug that though </s>

but then you need to do hardware modifications etc sorry not hardware mods , but manually reload the os . </s>
it just will boot into grub recovery , and only way to get into lubuntu or windows is using the live cd again and repairing the boot </s>
i shall . right now , got ta get this working ... </s>
plus we do n't get the spam while people on windows do . </s>

you must be doing a syncronous write walex , reading through the nfs docs ... i would n't recommend setting async on the server ... this seems more like a client issue . the client should be doing async actions , but is evidently doing sync actions so the write has to finish before the reads can be queued . there is a server async option but that just means that in the presence of a sync request from the client the server out and out lies to the client claiming its done </s>

cool , thanks ! </s>
sorry , i do n't know . mine says 0 used . sorry then i do n't know what can be wrong . this is perhaps not the recommended solution , but in your case i would try renaming my home directory and create a new one . perhaps it is something in your configuration that renders the chrasch . look at dr willis answer . it might be .xauthority . </s>
mist of the time i see that here its due to .xauthority </s>
yeah </s>
yes , they load correctly without errors must go , but thank you for your time . </s>

that behavior with your monitor seems unusual . anyway , just do stop lightdm </s>

is there a way to confirm that the drivers were installed correctly ? fglrxinfo seems to be listing the correct data </s>
makes sense , thank you </s>
thnx </s>
if i remember correctly servers register with rpc bind with the address they are listening and then when a client wants to communicate with the server , it asks rpcbind for its address so servers do n't have to listen to well know ports </s>

i just came here directly after a restart </s>
there is n't much out there for upstart .... it 's done basically manually . ubuntu users are n't expected to want to manage services ... uninstalling unwanted services is closest thing to ubuntu answer there are ways to stop services , by manually renaming the .conf files in etc init not init.d ! </s>

some of my peers yes </s>
you could try rc.local </s>
aaah that should due ty ! btw this command does not work on windows lol </s>

how do i request this information ? may it be useful to add a modeline to the monitor section ? xorg.conf is still correct , as i saved it . it is just refused during the initialization . after setting the resulution with nvidia settings , i called the display settings page in the gnome system configuration tool and saved it , now that i was able to chose 1600x1200 . then it persisted after rebooting and logging in into gnome classic desktop . </s>
its worth it imo </s>
anyway i ' ve harped on much too long at you about this . i 'll move on </s>
try ls and see if there are any files there </s>
exim is installed by default normally , you just have to configure set it up </s>
then server is probably your best bet . if it is older and you want to dedicate it to those services , you would have to do a lot of leaning out the desktop version to pare it down to just what you want </s>

no problem , will reboot one last time to confirm it 's working . i 'll report in a bit . </s>
oh , so just a liveusb then ? you wo n't be able to keep programs installed across reboots though that way . in that case i would set the size of the persistent partition to 4 gb on a 8 gb drive , or as high as they let you go i think the creator will not let you leave too little space for the os , should give ample space for documents and the like , which will remain across reboots . </s>
so something like cat chunk.gz.aa chunk.gz.ab chunk.gz.ac allchunks.gz the command line is a powerful tool and a dangerous weapon be careful , or it 'll cut your leg off of course if you want to cut your leg off , it 's not going to stop you </s>

i know </s>
you better stop teasing before you get us both silenced a good tip , when you get a warning and then see chanserv grant someone op status or similar , its time to run . </s>
does etc init isc dhcp server.conf exist ? what dhcp server did you install ? the dhcp3 server package is apparently now just linked to the isc dhcp server , i would suggest to just install that . did you do first sudo apt get update ? if still not found , you may be running an older ubuntu 8.04 or earlier if you are on the earlier ubuntu , should be a sysvinit called dhcp3 server so it would be called from upstart like sudo service dhcp3 server restart </s>
i was just reading where linus trashed nvidia . kind of makes it harder for me to sort out which is optimal . </s>
domedagen thanks , what 's the default wm for 12.10 then instead of unity ? would it install by default during upgrade or did you warn because there are issues with auto update ? </s>
well , ati is generally more open than nvidia to start with . hence why we have much better open source drivers for ati than nvidia . on the other hand nvidia 's proprietary drivers are supposedly better than the ati open source ones , but this difference has been less and less , and it not true in my personal experience though it probably is generally . also i 'm a bit of a loyalist , and with the rest of my hardware being ati amd , it </s>

if you are running 12.04 you can click on the unity button or hit the windows button then go to applications it will be under hardware drivers it runs by itself . blackness is right the apt get command will work . if you are done with installing grub give it a shot you should be good , then hop back on and let me know if i helped . </s>

indeed it does . </s>
what you might find useful is to test out your configuration in a vm like virtualbox first , then transfer your working version to the live server ... you 're pushing me over into ikonia 's camp the problem is that since you do n't know the ramifications of what you 're doing , you do n't have a context for judging whether you are making it more secure , or less secure best way to increase security is to not run services you do n't need .... other than that , it 's experience , like ikonia said what passwords are you worried about people brute forcing ? ok , the recommendation to only allow ssh authentication using ssh keys on one of those pages was a good one </s>
amen to that . i could n't agree more lol playing around with multiple platforms is beneficial in many ways . i simply see it as expanding technical knowledge and , as you ' ve mentioned , securing your job position lol one other application that has prevented me from fully switching operating systems , as well foobar2000 only on windows , sadly </s>

i ' ve actually asked about why the hostname was required i was told to check the man page sure enough , it 's documented . imo it 's a huge pain , 'cause you ca n't just transfer the file to new installs , must rename with box 's hostname attached to the file see jrib 's comment above . i do n't seem to use .xresources ie . not one on my install right now , so ca n't confirm </s>

it is possible to get , install and run network connect completely without java and for the keys , in .juniper networks network connect config that does n't solve your dynamic ip issue though . just thought you 'd like to know you can avoid the web browser java plug in authentication a possible solution would be to get yourself a free micro aws ec2 host instance , configure it as a proxy , and use it to relay your connections . although if it gets stopped started it could also change its ip . you can get static ips in some of the paid for services . </s>

no idea if you do n't see the folders doing ' ls l ' in a terminal , they are gone it certainly should not do that , but that 's why you 're supposed to back up your data before you do upgrades </s>

i would need more information than that ... but the long and short of it is that if it can not be seen by lspci , you can not use it . yes , it is , and it is why you are here . this is most of what i have done for the last 2 years , is automate driver installs for various hardware , especially gpus . i can give you every possible driver a card can use , but if the system can not even see the device , it can not and will not be used . your system has to see hardware to use it . this is not a limitation of flexibility ... something is wrong with the card or its seating power needs the biggest problem with x is its archaic nature . what you are saying is nonsense . it has not devolved . please power down the system , and check that the card is properly installed . </s>

no problem , just remember it is all an ip hack basically , you are trying to limit incoming packets , so the buffer of the isp does n't get full , causing dropouts . on wireless it might be even different still . and the only way to somehow limit incoming packets , because it is n't directly possible and out of control for you , is to make the other side , the server , think you can not cope with more packets , so the sender slows down . this only works with one server , that 's why it is unreliable when you open many tabs at once . unless you limit you download speed to 10 or somethin per connection </s>
